# 🧠 Em's Modified 7 Modern Languages in 7 Weeks Syllabus 
> Core programming concepts across 7 modern languages that resonate to exdnet's themes (memory, emotion, drift, states)

I'm having such a fun time goofing off and being silly designing my own course reviews while practicing syntax in other languages bc the original 7 mod langs was too bland for my taste 

> #we are at the pinnacle of self-taught education 

This is a progressive tracker for my own revisions so who knows how it'll evolve over time 🤷‍♀️

---

## Week 7: Modular Systems & Code Integration
**📚 Topics:**  
- Organizing large codebases (folders, packages, imports)
- Multi-file integration and script orchestration
- CLI toolkits 
- Lightweight configuration (e.g. .json, .toml)
- Managing dependencies and run modes

**💖 EXD-Aligned Practice:**  
- `exd_cli`: CLI tool to simulate a drift session with arguments
