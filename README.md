# 🧠 Em's Modified 7 Modern Languages in 7 Weeks Syllabus 
Core programming concepts across 7 modern languages that resonate to my relevance (memory, emotion, drift, states).I'm having such a fun time goofing off and being silly while learning syntax in other languages but the original 7 mod langs was too bland for my taste 

This is a progressive tracker for my own studies so who knows how it'll deviate over time 🤷‍♀️

### 🗂️ Languages Covered:
- Python 🐍  
- TypeScript 🌀  
- Rust 🦀  
- Go 🏃  
- Julia 🧬  
- JavaScript ☕  
- R 📊 (bc why not ig)

---

## Week 7: Industry-Ready Tools  
**📚 Topics:**  
- Web frameworks

**💖 EXD-Aligned Practice:**  
- `exd_api`: mini API that returns current memory state  
- `scene_scraper`: gather example emotional scenes  
- `unit_companion`: test suite for personal bots  
- `loadwatcher`: production-style handler for multiple state streams  
- `auto_exd`: bot that responds to real-time state logs

---

## 🧭 Format
Each week contains:
- ✅ Core language walkthroughs  
- 🧠 5 EXD-aligned exercises per language  
- 🧪 Optional stretch challenges (e.g. drift visualization, memory graphs)  
- 🪞 Reflective bot-building prompts (to turn theory into story)

---

## 💫 Learning Outcomes
By the end, you’ll be able to:
- Write emotionally intelligent agents with different syntax
- Simulate memory reorganization in any language  
- Understand code as symbolic emotional modeling  
- Speak 7 languages — like a multilingual computational heartthrob 😌💾
