### 💖 EXD-Themed Exercises (Shared Across All 7 Languages)

Use the basic syntax you’ve learned to complete each. They’re simple in structure, but deeply EXD-personalized.

#### 🏧 `memory_bank` – associative memory dictionary  
Use a dictionary to store memory → emotion pairs.  
Add a few entries and print the emotional tone of `"brunch"`.

#### 🎬 `scene_set` – filter overlapping or duplicated emotions  
Use a set to store memory labels. Add a duplicate.  
Show that duplicates are removed.

#### 🕰️ `timeline_tuple` – structure emotional events as immutable snapshots  
Make a tuple of 3 meaningful events.  
Try to mutate it — watch it fail.

#### 🗺️ `trigger_map` – map stimuli → responses  
Create a dictionary mapping stimuli (e.g., `"text"`, `"smell"`) → emotional responses.  
Add or update a mapping.

#### 📓 `em_logbook` – history of state changes using a list of dicts  
Use a list of dictionaries to simulate memory snapshots.  
Each dict contains something like:  
`{"time": "14:10", "state": "triggered"}`
