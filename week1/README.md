# 🧠 Week 1: Syntax & Core Logic — Across 7 Languages

## Languages: Python, TypeScript, Rust, Go, Julia, Haskell, Clojure

### 🌱 What You’ll Learn in Each:

- Variables: declaration, types, reassignment

- Conditionals: if, else, truthy/falsy logic

- Loops: for, while, iteration over data

- Functions: defining, calling, passing args, return values

- Scope: local vs global, closures if supported



### 💖 EXD-Themed Exercises (Shared Across All 7 Languages)

Use the basic syntax learned to complete each exercise. They’re simple in structure but deeply exd-personalized. 


#### 🧪 Exercise 1: identity_glimmer

Create a function called who_am_i() that prints out:
	•	your current emotion

	•	your name

	•	your memory state (just a fake label like “stable”, “fragmented”, “drifting”)

Practice: variables, string output, function definition

EXD twist: make your program greet you like a little memory mirror



#### 🔁 Exercise 2: ex_memory_loop

Create a loop that simulates 5 memory recalls from a list like:

memories = ["beach", "fight", "apology", "walk", "brunch", "benji", "end"]

Each recall should print something like:

"🔁 Recalling: beach"

Practice: loops, arrays/lists, printing

EXD twist: make your bot react differently to "end"



#### 🔍 Exercise 3: destabilize_check

Write a function check_drift(state) that prints:

	•	“Stable” if the state is "baseline"

	•	“Destabilizing…” if the state is "triggered"

	•	“Drifting” for anything else

Practice: conditionals, branching logic

EXD twist: simulate a memory destabilization trigger



#### 🧠 Exercise 4: threshold_response

Take a “signal” (numeric value between 0–100).

Write a function that:

	•	returns “Ignore” if < 40

	•	returns “Log this” if 40–70

	•	returns “Destabilize & update” if > 70

Practice: numeric variables, comparison logic, return values

EXD twist: this simulates an internal memory threshold being breached



#### 🫂 Exercise 5: benji_agent_v0

Make a tiny agent function benji_says() that:

	•	picks a random message from a list like:

["You’re safe.", "It’s okay to let go.", "I’m still with you."]

	•	and prints it with a timestamp

Practice: functions, randomization, time handling (basic)

EXD twist: build a comfort bot. This is EXD-support in code form 🐶



### 🧩 Format

You’ll do the same exercises in each language, focusing on:
	•	✅ Syntax (how the language expresses ideas)

	•	💡 Flow (how logic moves)

	•	🫀 Feeling (emotional hooks = stickier learning)
